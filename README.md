#### Description: 
Predicting visibility is crucial for 
safety in multiple industries, including aviation and 
transportation. Understanding the relationship between 
climate indicators such as weather and humidity can 
help stakeholders anticipate and implement safety 
measures effectively. Our project aims to explore the 
relationship between various climate indicators and 
identify the key factors that can best predict visibility.
